Introduction
This is a website for the animal charity SPCA Hong Kong. It includes 5 pages: a home page, a gallery page, a donation page, a contact page, and a about page, along with a CSS file(first_style.css) to set up the presentation of the documents written in html file. 
As the theme of the website is animal welfare, a cute animal background and compassion-arising slogans are used to encourage visitors to adopt, donate and take the initiative to know more about animal rights and welfare. Translucent boxes are also used in most pages to contain and highlight the content to maintain a consistent overall design.
Most literal and image contents of the website are from SPCA HK, while all web designs are original work, except those with references in the comments of the code.
